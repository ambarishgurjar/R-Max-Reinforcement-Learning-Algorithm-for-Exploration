# R-Max-Reinforcement-Learning-Algorithm-for-Exploration
R-Max algorithm as described by Brafman and Tennenholtz (2002).

Using Frozen Lake 4x4 environment.
I had limited computational power and time while implementing this.
Would love to see results if someone manages to get better results or does it for 8x8 environment

I am using the algorithm on Slide 33 of this ppt.
